Founded on the idea that a new paradigm for cooperative and collaborative knowledge-caching and sharing could have a transformative effect on the awareness and dissemination of spatial information, Guerrilla Cartography formed in 2012 to create Food: An Atlas.

The food atlas project was an experiment in guerrilla cartography and publishing. An open call for maps was shared and re-shared through a network of people who care about geography or food (or both) and the cartographers and researchers decided by their submissions what would be in the atlas.

The atlas was published by a consortium of supporters using a crowd-funding platform—the people made the atlas, literally gave it form. The project garnered a lot of media attention—for its content and its methodology—and we continue to receive requests for content to mount public and web-based exhibits.

As a registered California 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Guerrilla Cartography is committed to a free and open distribution of information. We sell volumes to support our organization but always allow free download of our content and pledge a share of our printed volumes to schools and libraries at no cost.

Our experiment in guerrilla cartography created more than an atlas.

At the present time, the herd consists of about 300 brood cows, half commercial and the other half purebred Angus. The commercial cattle are marketed locally, consisting of mainly black-baldies.

The farm is on the high ridge that divides the waters flowing into the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers.

This land grows a complex mix of lush grasses. The summers are cool and damp and the winters cold. The rocky soil is not suited for row crops, but it’s perfect for grazing healthy and happy cattle.

Our cattle eat what nature designed them to eat, nothing else: the grasses that grow naturally on these hills. In the warm weather they graze. In the winter they eat stored grasses from our own and surrounding farms, and still graze when the snow cover permits. We use no chemicals on the pastures and the animals are free of antibiotics.

The beef taste like beef should when grown in the mountains. It taste the way beef tasted forever, when people were willing to wait till cattle got fat on pasture—-before feedlots, before fossil fuels and corn, before antibiotics in the feed, before transport across the country. The connection between humans and cattle is so long, and so strong, that when you taste our grass feed beef it will likely trigger a memory of how good beef is supposed to taste.",,We raise grass fed beef on the hilly pastures of our farm in the Western Catskills.
