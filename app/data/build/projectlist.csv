In Bushwick, the open earth they occupy is rapidly receding as new parking lots, condominiums, and other development projects fill in the neighborhood’s remaining “vacant” spaces. This weedy sanctuary provides the opportunity to see these plants up close in an unusual context. I invite you to take a break from winter in the city.

Founded on the idea that a new paradigm for cooperative and collaborative knowledge-caching and sharing could have a transformative effect on the awareness and dissemination of spatial information, Guerrilla Cartography formed in 2012 to create Food: An Atlas.The food atlas project was an experiment in guerrilla cartography and publishing. An open call for maps was shared and re-shared through a network of people who care about geography or food (or both) and the cartographers and researchers decided by their submissions what would be in the atlas.The atlas was published by a consortium of supporters using a crowd-funding platform—the people made the atlas, literally gave it form. The project garnered a lot of media attention—for its content and its methodology—and we continue to receive requests for content to mount public and web-based exhibits.As a registered California 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Guerrilla Cartography is committed to a free and open distribution of information. We sell volumes to support our organization but always allow free download of our content and pledge a share of our printed volumes to schools and libraries at no cost.Our experiment in guerrilla cartography created more than an atlas. With more than 120 collaborators from 15 countries, the first guerrilla cartography project created a community—one that continues to grow.

It examined: why they purchase the food they do; where they shop and how often; beyond resource constraints, what influences their food purchasing choices; at what income level is it possible to secure a high quality regular diet; and what are the environmental, social and psychological factors that may prevent a strategic approach to food purchases and consumption? At the centre of this research was an exploration of how the local/immediate food suppliers (spaza shops, street vendors, informal cooking facilities) contribute to the food ecosystem.
