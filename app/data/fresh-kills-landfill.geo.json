    "POPUPCONTENT": "New York didn't always ship their trash away to far off places. After years of dumping trash in rivers, New York adopted the \"land-fill\" method that we know today. In 1948, Fresh Kills Landfill was opened. Originally intended as a temporary solution, and slated to close in 1968, Fresh Kills quickly became the main dumping ground for New York City. As other local landfills closed, reliance on Fresh Kills became even greater. Fresh Kills grew to the point where it was considered not only the largest landfill in the world, but the largest man-made structure. The landfill was officially closed in 2001, and in 2008 a 20-year redevlopment plan was implemented to convert the landfill into New York Cities largest park.",
